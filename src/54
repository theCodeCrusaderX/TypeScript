## ✅ What this means

```ts
type ChaiOrder = {
  type: string;
  sugar: number;
  strong: boolean;
};
```

You are **creating a type alias** called `ChaiOrder`.

Inside the `{ ... }` you define the **shape of an object** — meaning what properties it must have and their types:

| Part     | Meaning                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `type:`  | a **property name** (like a key in an object) |
| `string` | the **data type of that property**            |
| `;`      | separator (like `,`, both are allowed)        |

So:

```ts
type: string
```

means:

> The object must have a property called **type**, and its value must be a **string**.

Same for the others:

```ts
sugar: number     // must be a number
strong: boolean   // must be true/false
```

## 🧠 Why your tutor calls it an “object type”

Because this:

```ts
{
  type: string;
  sugar: number;
  strong: boolean;
}
```

describes the **structure (shape) of an object**.
So a valid `ChaiOrder` **must look like this:**

```ts
const order: ChaiOrder = {
  type: "Masala",
  sugar: 2,
  strong: true
};
```

This works 👌

But this will give an **error**, because `sugar` should be a number:

```ts
const wrongOrder: ChaiOrder = {
  type: "Black",
  sugar: "less",   // ❌ TypeScript error
  strong: false
};
```

---

## 🔹 Why semicolons instead of commas?

In **TypeScript object type definitions**, both are valid:

```ts
// This works
{
  type: string;
  sugar: number;
  strong: boolean;
}

// This also works
{
  type: string,
  sugar: number,
  strong: boolean,
}
```

Semicolons are just the default style — but **it is still describing an object type**, even if it looks a bit different from JavaScript objects.

---

## 🆚 Difference from a real object

This is **NOT an object itself**:

```ts
type ChaiOrder = { ... }   // ❌ NOT an object value
```

It is **only a blueprint for objects** — like saying:

> “Any `ChaiOrder` must have these properties and types.”

Then you **use it here:**

```ts
function makeChai(order: ChaiOrder) {
  console.log(order);
}
```

So `order` must match that structure.

---

## 🏁 Summary (simple words)

* `type ChaiOrder = {...}` → **blueprint**
* `type: string` → property named `type` must be a string
* semicolons `;` are just separators (like commas `,`)
* your tutor calls it an **object type** because it defines the structure of an object
* it is **NOT an object itself**
